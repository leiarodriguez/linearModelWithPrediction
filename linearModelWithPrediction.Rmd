Read about the data from the website where it is staged.  Then form three regression models; Model1 is SIMS~ARM, Model2 is SIMS~GRIP, and Model3 is SIMS~ARM+GRIP. For each model find a 95% prediction interval of SIMS given a value of 94  for GRIP and 88 for ARM. Compare Model1 with Model3 using anova. Write it up in a markdown document, push the project up to your github account and submit it back to canvas as link. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) 
data <- read.csv(file="https://onlinestatbook.com/case_studies_rvls/physical_strength/data.txt",sep="",header=TRUE)  
```

```{r}
Model1 = lm(SIMS~ARM, data = data)
print(summary(Model1))
```

```{r}
plot(data$SIMS,data$ARM)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
